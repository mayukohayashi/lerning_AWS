### Additional EB Exam Tips

- BeansTalk with HTTPS

  - Idea; Load the SSL certificate onto the Load Bakanler
  - Can be done from Console(EB console, load balancer configuration)
  - Can be done from the code: .ebextensions/securelistener-alb.config
  - SSL Certificate can be provisioned using ACM (AWC Certificate Manager) or CLI
  - Must configure a security group rule to allow incoming port 443 (HTTPS port)

- Beanstalk redirect HTTP to HTTPS
  - configure your instances to redirect to HTTPS
  - Or configure the Application Load Balancer (ALB only) with a rule
  - Make sure health checks are not redirected ( so they keep giving 200 OK)
