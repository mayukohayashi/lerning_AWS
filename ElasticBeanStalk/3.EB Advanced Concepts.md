### Elastic Beanstalk Extensions

- A zip file containing our code must be deployed to Elastic Beanstalk
- All the parameters set in the UI can be configured with code using files
- Requirements
  - in the .ebextensions/ directory in the root of source code
  - YAML / JSON format
  - .config extensions (example: logging config)
  - Able to modify some default settings using: option_settings
  - Ability to add resources such as RDS, ElastiCache, DynamoDB etc...
- Resources managed by .ebextensions get deleted if the environment goes away

### Elastic Beanstalk CLI

- we can install an additional CLI called the "EB cli" which makes working with Beanstalk from the CLI reasier

### EB Under the Hood

- Under the hood, EB relies on CloudFormation
- CloudFormation is an AWS service we will see later

### EB Deployment Mechanism

- Describe dependencies
  (requirements.txt for Python, package.json for Node.js)
- Package code as zip
- Zip file is uploaded to each EC2 machine
- Each EC2 machine resolves dependencies(SLOW)
- Optimization in case of long deployments: Package dependencies with source code to improve deployment performance and speed
