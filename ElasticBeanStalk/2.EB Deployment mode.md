## Elastic BeanStalk Deployment Option for Updates

- All at onece (deploy all in one go) - fastest, but instances are not available to serve traffic for a bit
- Rolling: upgrade a few instances at a time (bucket), and then move onto the next bucket once the first bucket is healthy
- Rolling with additional batched: like rolling, but spins up new instances to move the batch (so that he old application is still available)
- Immutable: spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys version to these instances, and then swaps all the instances when everything is healthy

## Elastic Beanstalk Deployment All at once

- Fastest deployment
- application has downtime
- Great for quick iterations in development environment
- No additional cost

## Elastic BeanStalk Deployment Rolling

- Application is running below capacity
- Can set the bucket size

## Elastic BeanStalk Deployment Rolling with additional batches

- Application is running at capacity
- Can set the bucket size
- Application is running both versions simultaneously
- Small additional cost
- Additional batch is removed at the end of the deployment
- Longer deployment
- Good for prod

## Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Immutable

- Zero downtime
- New Code is deployed to new instances on a temporary ASG
- High cost, double capacity
- Longest deployment
- Quick rollback in case of failures (just terminate new ASG)
- Great for prod
