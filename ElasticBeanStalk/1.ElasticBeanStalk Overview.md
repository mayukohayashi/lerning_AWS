### Developer problems on AWS

- Managing infrastructure
- Deploying Code
- Configuring all the databases, load balancers etc
- Scaling concerns
- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All the developers want is for their code to run!
- Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments

### AWS ElasticBeanStack Overview

- ElasticBeanStalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- It uses all the component's we have seen before:
  EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS etc...
- But it is all in one view that is easy to make sense of!
- We still have full control over the configuration
- BeanStalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances

## ElasticBeanStalk

- Managed service
  - Instance configuration / OS is handled by beanstalk
  - Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by ElasticBeanStalk
- Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer
- These architecture models:
  - Single Instance deployment: good for dev
  - LB + ASG: grant for production or pre-production web applications
  - ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers etc...)
- ElasticBeanStalk has three components
  - Application
  - Application version: each deployment gets assigned a version
  - Environment name (dev, test, prd...): free naming
- You deploy application versions to environments and can promote application versions to the next environment
- Rollback feature to previous application version
- Full control over lifecycle of environment
- Support for many platforms:
  - Go
  - Java SE
  - Java with Tomcat
  - .NET on Window Server with IIS
  - Node.js
  - PHP
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Packer Builder
  - Single Container Docker
  - Multicontainer Docker
  - Preconfigured Docker
- If not supported, you can write your own platform(advanced)
