### AWS S3 Overview - Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have globally unique name
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- Naming convention
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number

### AWS S3 Overview - Objects

- Objects (files) have a Key. The Key is the Full path:
  - <my_bucket>/my_file/txt
  - <my_bucket>/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
- There is no concept of "directions" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes(/)
- Objects Values are content of the body:
  - Max Size is 5TB
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multipart upload"
- Metadata (list of key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
- Varsion ID (if versioning is enabled)
