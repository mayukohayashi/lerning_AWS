### AWS S3 Performance - Key Names Historic fact and current exam

- When you had > 100 TPS (transaction per second), S3 performance could degrade
- Behind the scene, each object goes to an S3 partition and for the best performance. we want the highest partition distribution
- In the exam, and historically, it was recommended to have random characters in front of your key name to optimize performance
  - <my_bucket>.4asd_my_folder/my_file1.txt
  - <my_bucket>.geww_my_folder/my_file2.txt
- It was recommended never to use dates to prefix keys:
  - <my_bucket>.2019_02_22_my_folder/my_file1.txt
  - <my_bucket>.2019_09_22_my_folder/my_file2.txt

### AWS S3 Performance - Key Names Historic fact and current performance(not in exam yet)

- As of July 17th 2018, we can scale up to 3500 RPS for PUT and 5500 RPS and GET for EACH PREFIX
- "This S3 request rate performance increase removes any previous guidance to randomize object achieve faster performance"
- It is a "good to know" until the exam gets updated

### AWS S3 Performance

- Faster upload of large objects (>=100MB), use multipart upload:
  - parallelizes PUTs greater though
  - maximize your network bandwidth and efficiency
  - decrease time to retry in case a part fails
  - MUST use multi-part if object size is greater than 5GB
- Use CloudFront to cache S3 objects around the world (improves reads)
- S3 Transfer Acceleration (uses edge locations) - just need to change the endpoint you write to, not the code.
- if using SSE-KMS encryption, you may be limited to your AWS limits for KMS usage (~100s - 1000s downloads / uploads per second)
