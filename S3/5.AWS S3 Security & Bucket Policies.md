### S3 Security

- User based
  - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- Resource Based
  - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allow cross account
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control Lost (ACL) - less common

### S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  - Effect: Allow / Deny
  - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grand public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

### S3 Security - Other

- Networking:
  - Supports VPC Endpoints (for instance in VPC without www internet)
- Logging and Audit:
  - S3 access logs can be stored in other S3 bucket
  - API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
- User Security:
  - MFA (multi factor authentication) can be required in versioned buckets to delete objects
  - Signed URLs: URLs that are valid only for a limited time (ex: premium video service for logged in users)
