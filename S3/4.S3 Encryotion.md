### S3 Encryption for Objects

- There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
  - SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
  - SEE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
  - SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
  - Client Side Encryption
- It is important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation for the exam

### SSE-S3

- SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by AWS S3
- Object is encrypted server side
- AES-256 encryption type
- Must set header: <u>"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"</u>

### SSE-KMS

- SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
- KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
- Object is encrypted server side
- Must set header: <u>"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "awskms"

### SSE-C

- SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
- Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
- HTTPS must be used
- Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

### Client Side Encryption

- Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

### Encryption in transit (SSL)

- AWS S3 exposes:
  - HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
  - HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight
- You are free to use the endpoint you want, but HTTPS is recommended!
- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
- Encryption in flight is also called SSL/TLS
