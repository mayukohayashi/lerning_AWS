### AWS S3 - Consistency Model

- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
  - As soon as an object is written, we can retrieve it
    ex: (PUT => GET200)
  - This is true, except if we did a GET before to see if the object existed
    ex: (GET 404 => PUT 200 => GET 404) - eventually consistent
- Eventual Consistency for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects
  - if we read an object after updating. we might get the older version
    ex: (PUT 200 => PUT 200 => GET 200 (might be older version))
  - if we delete an object. we might still be able to retrieve it for a short time
    ex: (DELETE 200 => GET 200)
