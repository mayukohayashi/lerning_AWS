## AWS SDK Overview

- What if you want to perform actions on AWS directly from your applications code?(without using the CLI)
- You can use an SDK (software development kit)!
- Official SDKs are...

  - Java
  - .NET
  - Node.js
  - PHP
  - Python
  - Go
  - Ruby
  - C++

- We have to use AWS SDK when coding against AWS Services such as DynamoDB
- Fun fact.... the AWS CLI uses the Python SDK (boto3)
- The exam expects you to know when you should use an SDK
- We will practice AWS SDK when we get to the Lambda functions
- Good to know: If you do not spe

## AWS SDK Credential Security

- It is recommended to use the default credential provider chain
- The default credential provider chain works seamlessly with:

  - AWS credentials at ~/.aws/credentials (only on our computers or on premise)
  - Instance Profile Credentials using IAM Roles (for EC2 machines, etc...)
  - Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

- Overall Never EVER STORE AWS CREDENTIALS IN YOUR CODE
- Best practice is for credentials to be inherited from mechanisms above, and 100% IAM Roles if working from within AWS Services

## Exponential Backoff

- Any API that fails because of too many calls needs to be retrieved with exponential Backoff
- These apply to rate limited API
- Retry mechanism included in SDK API calls
