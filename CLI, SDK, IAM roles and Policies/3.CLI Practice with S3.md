> Single Local File and S3 Object Operations
> Some commands perform operations only on single files and S3 objects.
> The following commands are single file/object operations if no --recur-
> sive flag is provided.

>           o cp
>
>           o mv
>
>           o rm

>        For  this  type of operation, the first path argument, the source, must
>        exist and be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument,  the
>        destination,  can  be  the  name  of  a local file, local directory, S3
>        object, S3 prefix, or S3 bucket.
>
>        The destination is indicated as a local directory,  S3  prefix,  or  S3
>        bucket if it ends with a forward slash or back slash.  The use of slash
>        depends on the path argument type.  If the path argument  is  a  Local-
>        Path,  the type of slash is the separator used by the operating system.
>        If the path is a S3Uri, the forward slash must always be  used.   If  a
>        slash  is at the end of the destination, the destination file or object
>        will adopt the name of the source file or object.  Otherwise, if  there
>        is no slash at the end, the file or object will be saved under the name
>        provided.  See examples in cp and mv to illustrate this description.
