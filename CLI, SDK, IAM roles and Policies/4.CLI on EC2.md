### AWS CLI ON EC2... THE BAD WAY

- we could run `aws configure` on EC2 just like we did (and it will work)
- But it is SUPER INSECURE
- NEVER EVER PUT YOUR PERSONAL CREDENTIALS ON AN EC2
- Your PERSONAL credentials are PERSONAL and only belong on your PERSONAL computer

- If the EC2 is a compromised, so is your personal account
- If the EC2 is shared, other people may perform AWS actions while impersonating you

- For EC2, there is a better way... it is called AWS IAM Roles

### AWS CLE ON EC2... THE RIGHT WAY

- IAM Roles can be attached to EC2 instances
- IAM Roles can come with policy authorizing exactly what the EC2 instance should be able to do
- EC2 Instances can then use these profiles automatically without any additional configurations
- This is the best practice on AWS and you should 100% do this
