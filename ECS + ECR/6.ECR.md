### ECR

- So far we have been using Docker images from Docker Hub (public)
- ECR is a private Docker image repository
- Access is controlled through IAM (permission errors => policy)
- You need to run some commands to pull:
  - \$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region eu-west-1)
  - docker push 1234545.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest
  - docker pull 1234545.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo:latest
