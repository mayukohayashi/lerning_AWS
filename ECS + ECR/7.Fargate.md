### Fargate
- When launching an ECS Cluster, we have to create our EC2 instances
- If we need to scale, we need to add EC2 instances
- So we manage infrastructure...

- With Fargate, it is all Serverless!
- We dont provision EC2 instances
- We just create task definitions, and AWS will run our containers for us
- To scale, just increase the task number, Simple! No more EC2!
