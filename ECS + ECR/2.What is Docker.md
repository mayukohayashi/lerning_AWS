### What is Docker?

- Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
- Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
- Apps run the same, regardless of where they re run
  - Any machine
  - No compatibility
  - Predictable behavior
  - Less work
  - Easier to maintain and deploy
  - Works with any language, any OSm any technology

### Where Docker images are stored?

- Docker images are stored in Docker Repositories
- Public: Docker Hub
  - Find base images for many technologies or OS:
  - Ubuntu
  - MySQL
  - NodeJS etc...
- Private; Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

### Docker versus Virtual Machines

- Docker is "sort of" a virtualization technology, but not exactly
- Resources are shared with the host => many containers on one server

### Docker Containers Management

- To manage containers, we need a container management platform

- 3 choices:
  - ECS: Amazon's own platform
  - Fargate: Amazon's own Serverless platform
  - EKS: Amazon's managed Kubernetes (open source)
