### What are mapping?

- Mappings are fixed variables within your CloudFormation Template.
- There are very handy to differentiate between different environments (dev vsd prod), region (AWS regions), AMI types etc
- All the values are hardcoded within the template

### When would you use mappings vs parameters?

- Mappings are great when you know in advance all the values that can be taken and that they can be deduced from variables such as:
  - Region
  - Availability Zone
  - AWS Account
  - Environment(dev vs prod) etc
  - They allow safer control over the template
  - Use parameters when the values are really user specific

### Fn::FindInMap

- We use Fn::FindInMap to return a named value from a specific key
- !FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]
