### Infrastructure as Code

- Currently, we have been doing a lot of manual work
- All this manual work will be very tough to reproduce:
  - In another region
  - in another AWS Account
  - Within the same region if everything was deleted
- would not it be great, if all our infrastructure was.... code?
- That code would be deployed and create/ update/ delete our infrastructure

### What is CloudFormation

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
  - I want a security group
  - I want 2 EC2 machines using this security group
  - I want 2 Elastic IPs for those EC2 machines
  - I want an S3 bucket
  - I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

### Benefits of AWS CloudFormation

- Infrastructure as code
  - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
  - The code can be version controlled for example using git
  - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
- Cost
  - Each sources within the stack is staged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack cost you
  - You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
  - Saving strategy: In Dev you could automation deletion of template at 5PM and recreated 8AM, safely
- Productivity
  - Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
  - Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
  - Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
- Separation of concern: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers.
  - VPC stacks
  - Network stacks
  - App stacks
- Do not re-invent the wheel
  - Leverage existing templates on the web!
  - Leverage the documentation!

### HOw CloudFormation Works

- Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation
- To update a template, we can not edit previous ones. We have to re-upload a new version of the template to AWS
- Stacks are identified by a name
- Deleting a stack deletes every single artifact that was created by CloudFormation

### Deploying CloudFormation templates

- Manual way:
  - Editing templates in the CloudFormation Designer
  - Using console to input parameters, etc
- Automated way:
  - Editing templates in a YAML file
  - Using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) to deploy the templates
  - Recommended the way when you fully want to automate your flow

### CloudFormation Building Blocks

- Templates components (one course section for each)
  1. Resources: your AWS resources declared in the template (MANDATORY)
  2. Parameters: the dynamic inputs for your template
  3. Mappings: the static variables for your template
  4. Outputs: references to what has been created
  5. Conditionals: List of conditions to perform resource creation
  6. Metadata
- Template helpers
  1. References
  2. Functions
