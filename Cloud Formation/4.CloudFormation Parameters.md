### What are parameters?

- parameters are a way to provide inputs to your AWS CloudFormation template
- They are important to know about if:
  - You want to reuse your templates across company
  - Some inputs can not be determined ahead of time
- Parameters are extremely powerful, controlled and can prevent errors from happening in your templates thanks to types.

### When should you use a parameter?

- Ask yourself this:
  - Is this CloudFormation resources configuration likely to change in the future?
  - If so, make it a parameter.
- You won't have to re-upload a template to change its content!

### How to Reference Parameter

- The <u>Fn::Ref</u> function can be leveraged to reference parameters
- Parameters can be used anywhere in a template
- The shorthand for this in YAML is <u>!REF</u>
- The function can also reference other elements within the template

### Concept: Pseudo Parameters

- AWS offers us pseudo parameters in any CloudFormation template
- These can be used at any time and are enabled by default
