### ElastiCache patterns

- ElastiCache is helpful for <u>read-heavy</u> application workloads
  - social networks, gaming, media sharing, Q&A portals
- & <u>compute-intensive</u> workloads (recommendation engines)

- There are 2 patterns / cache strategies for ElastiCache

  - Lazy Loading
  - Wtite Through

- Strategies may be different based pn the kind of application you have

### Lazy Loading - Load only when necessary

- Pros
  - Only requested data is cached (the cache isnt filled up with unused data)
  - Node failures are not fatal (just increased latency to warn the cache)
- Cons
  - Cache miss penalty that results in 3 round trips noticeable delay for that request
  - Stale data; data can be updated in the database and outdated in the cache

### Write Through - Add or Update cache database is updated

- Pros
  - Data in cache is never stale
  - Write penalty vs Read penalty (each write requires 2 calls)
- Const
  - Missing Data until it is added / updated in the DB. Migration is to implement Lazy Loading strategy as well
  - Cache churn - a lot of the data will never be read
