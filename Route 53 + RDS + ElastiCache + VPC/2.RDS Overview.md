## AWS RDS Overviews

- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- Its a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - Oracle
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Properietary database)

## Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

- Managed service
- OS patching level
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
- Monitoring dashboards
- Read replicas for improved read performance
- Multi AZ set up for DR (Disaster Recovery)
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
- BUT you cant SSH into your instances

### RDS Read Replicas for read scalability

- Up to 5 Read Replixas
- Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
