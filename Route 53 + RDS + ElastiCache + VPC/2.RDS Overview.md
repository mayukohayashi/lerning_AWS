## AWS RDS Overviews

- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- Its a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - Oracle
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Properietary database)

## Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

- Managed service
- OS patching level
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
- Monitoring dashboards
- Read replicas for improved read performance
- Multi AZ set up for DR (Disaster Recovery)
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
- BUT you cant SSH into your instances

### RDS Read Replicas for read scalability

- Up to 5 Read Replixas
- Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

### RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)

- SYNC replication
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
- Increase <u>availability</u>
- Failover in case of loss of AZ,
- loss of network, instance or storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling

### RDS Backups

- Backups are automatically enbled in RDS
- Automated backups
  - Daily full snapshot of the database
  - Capture transaction logs in real time
  - => ability to restore to any point in time
  - 7 days retention (can be increased to 35days)
- DB Snapshots:
  - Manually triggered by the user
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want

### RDS Encryotion

- Encryption at rest capability with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
- SSL certificate to encrypt data to RDS in flight
- To enforce SSL:
  - Postgres SQL: rds.force_ssl=1 in the AWS RDS Console (Parameter Groups)
  - MySQL: within the DB: GRAND USAGE ON _._ TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL
- To connect using SSL:
  - Provide the SSL Trust certificate (can be download from AWS)
  - Provide SSL options when connecting to database

### RDS Security

- RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
- RDS Security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2 instances) - it controls who can <u>communicate</u> with RDS
- IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS
- Traditional Username and Password can be used to login to the database
- IAM user can now be used too (for MYSQL / Aurora - NEW)

### RDS vs Aurora

- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
- Aurora is "AWS cloud optimised" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB up to 64TB
- Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. Its HA native
- Aurora costs more than RDS(20% more) - but is more efficient
