### AWS VPC

- Within a Region, you're able to create VPCs (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Each VPC contains subnets (networks)
- Each subnet must be mapped to an AZ(AreaZone)
- Its common to have a public subnet (public IP)
- Its common to have a private subnet (private IP)
- Its common to have many subnets per AZ
- Public Subnets usually contains:

  - Load Balancers
  - Static Websites
  - Files
  - Public Authentication Layers

- Public Subnet usually contains:
  - Load Balancers
  - Static Websites
  - Files
  - Public Authentication Layers
- Private Subnet usually contains:

- Public and private subnets can communicate if they are in same VPC!

### AWS VPC Brain Dump

- VPC & Regions arent much asked at the developer associate exam
- All new accounts come with a default VPC
- It is possible to use a VPN to connect to VPC (and access all the private IP straight from your laptop)
- VPC Flow Logs allow you to monitor the traffic within, in and out of your PC (useful for security, performance, audit)
- VPC are per Account per Region
- Subne are per VPC per AZ
- Some AWS resources can be deployed in VPC while others cannot
- You can peer VPC (within or across accounts) to make it look like they are part of the same network
