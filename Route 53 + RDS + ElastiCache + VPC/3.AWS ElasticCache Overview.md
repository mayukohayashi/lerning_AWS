### AWS ElastiCache Overview

- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases...
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
- Helps make your application stateless
- Write Scaling using sharding
- Real Scaling using Read Replicas
- Multi AZ with Failover Capability
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups

### ElastiCache Solution Architecture - DB Cache

- Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache.
- Helps relieve load in RDS
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there.

### ElastiCache Solution Architecture - User Session Store

- User logs into any of the application
- The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
- The user hits another instance of our application
- The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in

### Redis Overview

- Redis is an in-memory key-value store
- Super low latency (sub ms)
- Cache survive reboots by default (its called persistance)
- Great to host
  - User sessions
  - Leader board (for gaming)
  - Distributed statusÂ¥
  - Relieve pressure on databases (such as RDS)
  - Pub / Sub capability for messaging
  - Multi AZ with Automatic Failover for disaster recovery if you dont want to lose your cache data
- Support for Read Replicas

### Memcached Overview

- memcached is an in-memory object store
- Cache doesnt survive reboots
- Use cases:
  - Quick retrieval of objects from memory
  - Cache often accessed objects
- Overall, Redis has largely grown in popularity and has better feature sets than Memcached
- I would personally use Redis caching needs
- AWS exam would not ask if Redis or Memcached is better. Just "ElastiCache" in general
