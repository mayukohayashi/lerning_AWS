### CodeBuild Overview

- Fully managed build service
- Alternative to other build tools such as Jenkins
- Continuous scaling (no services to manage or provision - no build queue)
- Pay for usage: the time it takes to complete the builds
- Leverages docker under the hood for reproducing builds
- Possibly to extend capabilities leveraging our own base Docker image
- Secure: integration with KMS for encryption of build artifasts, IAM for build permissions, and VPC for network security, CloudTrail for API calls logging
- Source Code from GitHub / CodeCommit / CodePipeline / S3...
- Build instructions can be defined in code (buildspec.yml file)
- Output logs to Amazon S3 & AWS CloudWatch Logs
- Metrics to monitor CodeBuild statistics
- Use CloudWatch Alarms to detect failed builds and trigger notifications
- CloudWatch Events / AWS Lambda as a Glue
- SNS nortifications
- Ability to reproduce CodeBuilds locally to troubleshoot in case of errors
- Builds can be defined within CodePipeline or CodeBuild itself

### CodeBuild BuildSpec

- buildspec.yml file must be at the root of your code
- Define environment variables:
  - Plaintext variable
  - Secure secrets: use SSM Prarameter store
- Phases (specify commands to run):
- Install: install dependencies you may need for your build
- Pre build: final commands to execute before build
- Build: Actual build command
- Post build: finishing touched (zip output for example)
- Artifacts: What to upload to S3 (encrypted with KMS)
- Cache; Files to cache (usually dependencies) to S3 for future build speedup

### CodeBuild Local Build

- In case of need deep troubleshooting
- You can run CodeBuild locally on your desktop (after installing Docker)
- For this, leverage the CodeBuild Agent
