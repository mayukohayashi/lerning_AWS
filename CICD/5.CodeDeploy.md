### AWS CodeDeploy

- We want to deploy our application automatically to many EC2 instances
- These instances are not managed by ElasticBeanstalk
- There are several ways to handle deployments using open source tools (Ansible, Terraform, Chef, Puppet...)
- We can use the managed Service AWS CodeDeploy

### AWS CodeDeploy - Steps to make it work

- Each EC2 Machine (or On Premise machine) must be running the CodeDeploy Agent
- The agent is continuously polling AWS CodeDeploy for work to do
- CodeDeploy sends appsepec.yml file
- Application is pulled from GitHub or S3
- EC2 will rin the deployment instructions
- CodeDeploy Agent will report of success / failure deployment on the instance

### AWS CodeDeploy - Other

- EC2 instances are grouped by deployment group (dev / test / prod)
- Lots of flexibility to define any kind of deployments
- CodeDeploy can be chained into CodePipeline and use artifacts from there
- CodeDeploy can re-use existing setup tools, works with any application, auto scaling integration
- Note: Blue / Green only works with EC2 instances (not on premise)
- Support for AWS Lambda deployments (we will see this later)
- CodeDeploy does not provision resources

### AWS CodeDeploy Primary Components

- Application: unique name
- Compute platform: EC2 / On -Premise or Lambda
- Deployment configuration: Deployment rules for success / failures
  - EC2/On-premise: you can specify the minimum number of healthy instances for the deployment.
  - AWS Lambda: specify how traffic is routed to your updated Lambda function versions.
- Deployment group: group of tagged instances (allows to deploy gradually)
- Deployment type: In-place deployment or Blue/green deployment
- IAM instance profile: need to give EC2 the permissions to pull from S3/GitHub
- Application Revision: application code + appspec.yml file
- Service role: Role for CodeDeploy to perform what it needs
- Target revision: Target deployment application version

### AWS CodeDeploy AppSpec

- File Section: how to source and copy from S3 / Github to file system
- Hooks: set of insructure to do to deploy the new version (hooks can have timeouts).The order is:
  - ApplicationStop
  - DownloadBundle
  - BeforeInstall
  - AfterInstall
  - ApplocationStart
  - ValidationService: really important

### AWS CodeDeploy Deployment Config

- Configs:
  - One a time: one instance at a time, one instance fails => deployment stops
  - Half at a time: 50%
  - All at once: quick but no healthy host, downtime, Good for dev
  - Custom: min healthy host = 75%
- Failures:
  - Instances stay in "failed state"
  - New deployments will first be deployed to "failed state" instances
  - To rollback: redeploy old deployment or enable automated rollback for failures
- Deployment Targets:
  - Set of EC2 instances with tags
  - Directly to an ASG
  - Mix of ASG / Tags so you can build deployment segments
  - Customization in scripts with DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_NAME environment variables
