### CodeCommit

- Version control is the ability to understand the various changes that happend to the code over time (and possibly roll back)
- All those are enabled by using a version control system as Git
- A Git repository can live on one's machine, but it usually lives on a central online repository
- Benefits are:

  - Collaborate with other developers
  - Make sure the code is backed up somewhere
  - Make sure it is fully viewable and auditable

- Git repositories can be expensive
- The industory includes:
  - GitHub: free public repositories, paid private ones
  - BitBucket
  - Etc...
- And AWS CodeCommit:
  - private Git repositories
  - No size limit on repositories (scale seamlessly)
  - Fully managed, highly available
  - Code only in AWS Cloud account => increased security and compliance
  - Secure (encrypted, access control, etc...)
  - Integrated with Jenkins / CodeBuild / Other CI tools

### CodeCommit Security

- Interactions are done using Git (standard)
- Authentication in Git:
  - SSH Keys: AWS Users can configure SSH keys in their IAM Console
  - HTTPS: Done through the AWS CLI Authentication helper or Generating HTTPS credentials
  - MFA(multi factor authentication) can be enabled for extra safety
- Authorization in Git:
  - IAM policies manage user / roles rights to repositories
- Encryption
  - Repositories are automatically encrypted at rest using KMS
  - Encrypted in transit (can only use HTTPS or SSH - both secure)
- Cross Account access:
  - Do not share your SSH keys
  - Do not share your AWS credentials
  - Use IAM Role in your AWS Account and use AWS STS (with Assume Role API)

### CodeCommit vs GitHub

- Similarities:
  - Both are git repositories
  - Both support code review(pull request)
  - GitHub and CodeCommit can be integrated with AWS CodeBuild
  - Both support HTTPS and SSH method of authentication
- Differences:
  - Security:
    - GitHub; GitHub Users
    - CodeCommit; AWS IAM users & roles
  - Hosted;
    - GitHub: hosted by GitHUb
    - GitHub Enterprise: self hosted on your servers
    - CodeCommit: managed & hosted by AWS
  - UI:
    - GitHub: UI is fully featured
    - CodeCommit: UI is minimal

### CodeCommit Notifications

- You can trigger notifications in CodeCommit using AWS SNS (simple Notification Service) or AWS Lambda or AWS CloudWatch Event Rules
- Use cases for notifications SNS / AWS Lanbda notifications:
  - Deletion of branches
  - Trigger for pushes that happens in master branch
  - Notify external Build System
  - Trigger AWS Lambda function to perform codebase analysis (maybe credenntials got commited in the code?)
- Use cases for CloudWatch Event Rules:
  - Trigger for pull request updates (created/ updated/ deleted/ commented)
  - Commit comment events
  - CloudWatch Event Rules goes into an SNS topic
