### Code Pipeline

- Continuous delivery
- Visual workflow
- Source: GitHub/ CodeCommit/ Amazon S3
- Build: CodeBuild/ Jenkins/ etc...
- Load Testing: 3rd party tools
- Deploy;: AWS CodeDeploy/ Beanstalk/ CloudFormation/ ECS...
- Made of stages:
  - Each stage can have sequential actions and / or parallel actions
  - Stages examples: Build / Test / Deploy / Load Test / etc...
  - Manual approval can be defined any stage

### AWS CodePipeline Artifacts

- Each pipeline stage can create "artifacts"
- Artifacts are passed stored in Amazon S3 and passed on to the next stage

### CodePipeline Troubleshooting

- CodePipeline state changes happen in AWS CloudWatch Events, which can in return create SNS notifications
  - e.g.: you can create events for failed pipeline
  - e.g.: you can create events for cancelled stages
- If CodePipeline fails a stage, your pipeline stops and you can get information in the console
- AWS CloudTrail can be used to audit AWS API calls
- If Pipeline cant perform an action, make sure the "IAM Service Role" attached does enough permissions (IAM Policy)
