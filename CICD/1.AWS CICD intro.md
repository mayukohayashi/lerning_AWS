### CICD Section Introduction

- We no know how to create resources in AWS manually (Fundamentals)
- We know how to interact with AWS programmatically (CLI)
- We have seen how to deploy code to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk
- All these manual steps make it very likely for us to do mistakes!

- What we would like is to push our code "in a repository" and have it deployed onto the AWS
  - Automatically
  - The right way
  - Making sure it is tested before deploying
  - With possibility to go into different stages (dev, test, pre-prod, prod)
  - With manual approval where needed
- To be a proper AWS developer.... we need to learn AWS CICD

### CICD Section Introduction

- This section is all about automating the deployment we have done so far while adding increased safety
- It correspond to a whole part of the AWS Certification
- We will learn about
  - AWS CodeCommit: storing our code
  - AWS CodePipeline: automating our pipeline from code to ElasticBeanstalk
  - AWS CodeBuild: building and testing our code
  - AWS CodeDeploy: deploying the code to EC2 fleets (not Beanstalk)

### Continuous Integration

- Developers push the code to a code repository often (GitHub/ CodeCommit / Bitbucket...)
- A testing / build server checks the code as soon as it is pushed (CodeBuild / Jenkins CI etc...)
- The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed / failed
- Find bugs early fix bugs
- Deliver faster as the code is tested
- Deploy often
- Happier developer, as they are unblocked

### Continuous Delivery

- Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed
- Ensures deployments happen often and are quick
- Shift away from "one release every 3 months" to "5 releases a day"
- That usually means automated deployment
  - CodeDeploy
  - Jenkins CD
  - Spinnaker
  - Etc...
