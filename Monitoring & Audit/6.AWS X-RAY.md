### AWS X-RAY

- Debugging in Production, the good old way:
  - Test locally
  - Add log statements everywhere
  - Re-deploy
- Log formats differ across applications using CloudWatch and analytics is hard
- Debugging: monolith "easy", distributed services "hard"
- No common views of your entire architecture!
- Enter...AWS X-RAY!

### AWS X-RAY advantages

- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
- Pinpoint service issues
- Review request behavior
- Find errors and exceptions
- Are we meeting time SLA?
- Where I am throttled?
- Identify users that are impacted

### X-RAY compatibility

- AWS Lambada
- Elastic Beanstalk
- ECS
- ELB
- API Gateway
- EC2 Instances or any application server(even on premise)

### AWS X-RAY Leverages Tracing

- Tracing is an end to end way to following a "request"
- Each component dealing with the request add its own "trace"
- Tracing is made of segments (+ sub segments)
- Annotations can be added to traces to provide extra-information
- Ability to trace;
  - Every request
  - Sample request (as a % for example or a rate per minute)
- X-RAY Security
  - IAM for authorization
  - KMS for encryption at rest

### AWS X-RAY How to enable it?

1. Your code (Java, Python, Go, Node.js, .NET) must import the AWS X-ray SDK
   - Very little code modification needed
   - The application SDK will then capture:
     - Calls to AWS services
     - HTTP/HTTPS requests
     - Database Calls (MySQL, PostgresSQL, DynamoDB)
     - Queue calls (SQS)
2. Install the X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS Integration

- X-Ray daemon works as a low level UDP packet interceptor (Linux/Windows/Mac..)
- AWS Lambda / other AWS services already run the X-Ray daemon for you
- Each application must have the IAM rights to write data to X-Ray
