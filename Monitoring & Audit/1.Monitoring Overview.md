### Why Monitoring is Important

- We know how to deploy application
  - Safely
  - Automatically
  - Using Infrastructure as Code
  - Leveraging the best AWS components!
- Our applications are deployed, and our users do not care how we did it...
- Our users only care that the application is working!
  - Application latency: will it increase over time?
  - Application outages: customer experiences should not be degraded
  - Users contacting the IT department or complaining is not a good outcome
  - Troubleshooting and remediation
- Internal monitoring
  - Can we prevent issues before they happend?
  - Performance and Cost
  - Trends (scaling patterns)
  - Learning and Improvement
